- use of c preprocessor to get rid of duplicate code for vectorized implementation of heap, stack, freelist
- try to stop gc earlier:
	1. change the way in which gc scans the stack 
			ex. 1: down -> up
			    2: up ->down
	2. stop gc earlier if we found at least one new stop for the cons cell
	3. (MAYBE) choose between how often we'll call gc instead of realloc
	4. gc_sweep should also decrease count by one
	5. when there is an empty spot in freelist increase count by
	6. using 4,5 we could be able to stop gc earlier using a cnt for how many entries of hp we have already checked. if cnt == hp.count we could stop stack's scanning.
